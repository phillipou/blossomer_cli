### A/B Testing Framework Available

#### Experiment Setup
- **Test Structure**: 50/50 split between baseline and variation
- **Minimum Sample Size**: 100 emails per variation (200 total)
- **Test Duration**: 1-2 weeks minimum
- **Statistical Significance**: 95% confidence level required

#### Variation Analysis
**Baseline Email**: [Description of baseline approach]
**Variation Email**: [Description of variation approach]

**Variable Blocks**:
- [Block that varies]: [How it differs]
- [Block that varies]: [How it differs]

**Constant Blocks**:
- [Blocks that stay consistent]

**Hypothesis**: [What this test will validate about message-market fit]

#### Success Criteria
1. **Primary**: Reply rate improvement (minimum 20% relative lift)
2. **Secondary**: Open rate improvement
3. **Tertiary**: Click-through rate (if applicable)

#### Results Interpretation

**If Baseline Wins**:
- Validate current messaging approach
- Test more subtle variations
- Focus on improving targeting accuracy

**If Variation Wins**:
- Adopt variation as new baseline
- Develop new variations testing different use cases
- Update messaging framework based on learnings

**Segment Analysis**:
Analyze results by:
- Industry/vertical segments
- Company size tiers
- Funding stage differences
- Persona types/seniority levels
