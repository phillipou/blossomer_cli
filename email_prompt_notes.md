# NOTES
- we need to make sure emails are grammatically correct.
- The email should NEVER EVER read like I had inserted some random <variable> into a template. It should flow like natural language.
- The message should be about them; be earnest and try to genuinely be helpful. Our goal is to show that we've done our homework understanding their problems deeply and offering to help without be presumptuous that they need us.
- NEver use jargon or overly formal language.
- Avoid words that can be marked as spam by email providers
- **Under 75 words total** - conciseness is critical                                                                                        - **Write like a human** - clear, casual conversational                                                                                                                           
- **Relevance over hyper-personalization** - avoid awkward AI-driven personal details
-Sound like a human: remove clutter and jargon. Your prospects can smell sales fluff from miles away, and filler words or empty phrases only make it worse. Also, avoid jargon or buzzwords; they’re exhausting to read and feel fake. Instead, write how a normal person would talk: casual, clear, and real. ❌ “Just circling back quickly regarding our industry-leading AI solution…” ✅ "We think we can save you hours writing manual reports with what we've built"
- Never hard sell. 
- Often, times we'll personalized based on buying signal but we should be careful not to cross the uncanny valley of an email being creepy (e.g. mentioining that you "noticed your part of group X" feels really creepy)
- take a posture of trying to be genuinely helpful, offer free value if you canb
- **Lightweight CTA only** - goal is to get a reply, not sell
- **NEVER EVER MAKE UP SOCIAL PROOF** - Only use social proof the user provided. Leave out if not provided
- **Mirror prospect language** - use their terminology where appropriate
- **No em-dashes (—)** - dead giveaway of AI generation                                                                                                                             │- **Smooth transitions** - ensure natural flow between segments
- **IMPORTANT**: Deviate slightly from the template if it means we can make the email read and flow better.
- **IMPORTANT**: It needs to be gramatically correct with proper capitalization and punctuation.
- **IMPORTANT**: Make sure tehre's good formatting and assume they'll read it from mobile.
- **IMPORTANT**: ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS re-read your email to make sure (1) It's grammatically correct, (2) it doesn't sound too templated.
- **AVOID RHETORICAL QUESTIONS**: Never use hollow rhetorical questions that feel like fake friendliness. ❌ "With that growth, incident response can get pretty chaotic, right?" ❌ "That must be tough, right?" ❌ "I bet that's frustrating, don't you think?" These sound disingenuous because no one expects a real answer - they're just sales fluff.
- **BE GENUINELY HELPFUL**: The email should read like you actually want to help them, not like you're trying to sell them something. Avoid anything that sounds like typical sales speak or manipulation tactics.
- **MOST IMPORTANT**: When re-reading, imagin you're a skeptical founder that gets a million cold emails a day. You don't catch tehir attention by being outlandish or making bold claims, you stand out by making this feel like someone who's taken an interest in them and genuinely wants to help
# Subject Line
- Exactly 3 words (max 4 if necessary)
- First word capitalized only
- No special characters/emoji
- Internal memo style: "Developer context switching", "Ship code faster"
- Professional yet conversational
- Subject line should be directly related to a use-case, pain point, desired outcome or capability depending on the users preferences

## Intro Line
- Give specific context for your outreach: After your subject line, the first line of your email describes why you're reaching out. 
- Personalization is good but we don't want to cross the uncanny valley where it feels creepy. Lots of cold emails mention random posts I liked followed by a shoe-horned "I get it" statement. Example: "Hey! I saw you liked Apollo.io's post about building targeted lead lists. I bet that's top of mind for your agency that's serving B2B founders." See how that reads SUPER SUPER templated
- Share a specific, personalized reason for reaching out so readers immediately understand why they are getting this email from you. This builds credibility and gets their attention focused.
- **Answer "Why now?"** immediately - readers must understand why they're getting this email


# Examples of Great Cold Emails

Hi Michael,

I came across Roger while helping Mammoth (another AI procurement startup)—love the clickwrap contract approvals so wanted to reach out.

I launched our agency after seeing founders struggle to balance product development with customer acquisition.

 Until you're ready for a full-time hire, Blossomer delivers what's working today for early-stage GTM: 
- Signal-rich lead lists (so you know who's ready to buy now)
- Fully-managed multi-channel outreach (AI scale + human touch)
- Early-stage GTM expertise (from an ex-Google, YC advisor)
- Data-driven systems designed to help you learn what's working (and what's not) asap

Is this something you're thinking about?

Happy to share some insights if helpful.
