    "Targeting outbound sales-driven companies aligns with Blossomer's focus on building outbound systems and rapid execution, as these firms require strategic guidance to scale their outreach effectively.",
    "Focusing on small to mid-sized B2B companies (50-500 employees) ensures prospects have sufficient operational complexity and budget capacity to implement outbound strategies but are not yet at enterprise scale, making them ideal for rapid, strategic interventions.",
    "Companies in growth phases, especially those approaching or in Series B funding, are likely to seek structured outbound processes to sustain their expansion and overcome inefficiencies in their current outreach efforts.",
    "Firms with a focus on sales, marketing, or business development functions are more inclined to invest in outbound sales system building, making them prime candidates for Blossomer's services."
