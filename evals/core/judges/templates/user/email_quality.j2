## Instructions
Evaluate this email for:
1. **Email Naturalness**: Does it sound like a real founder wrote it?
2. **Genuine Helpfulness**: Does this feel like the sender actually wants to help vs just sell?
3. **Personalization Appropriateness**: Is the personalization level appropriate OR is the email hyper-relevant?
4. **Uncertainty Handling**: Are uncertain/gibberish inputs handled properly?
5. **Structure Compliance**: Does it follow founder outreach best practices?

**IMPORTANT**: For each check, identify and quote the specific lines/sentences from the email that most influenced your rating. These should be the exact text that made you give it that score.
