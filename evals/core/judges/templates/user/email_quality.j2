## Instructions
Evaluate this email for:
1. **Email Naturalness**: Does it sound like a real founder wrote it?
2. **Genuine Helpfulness**: Does this feel like the sender actually wants to help vs just sell?
3. **Personalization Appropriateness**: Is the personalization level appropriate OR is the email hyper-relevant?
4. **Uncertainty Handling**: Are uncertain/gibberish inputs handled properly?
5. **Structure Compliance**: Does it follow founder outreach best practices?
6. **Follow-Up Variety**: Does the follow-up email offer a different angle than the initial email?

**IMPORTANT**: For each check, identify and quote the specific lines/sentences from the email that most influenced your rating. When quoting text, ensure you properly escape any quotes or special characters for valid JSON format (replace " with \" and handle line breaks).

## Output Requirements

Return exactly 6 checks in this format. **CRITICAL**: Ensure all quoted text is properly escaped for JSON:
- Replace all " with \"  
- Replace line breaks with \\n
- Keep quoted text under 80 characters when possible
- If text contains quotes, use single quotes around it or summarize instead

Example of proper escaping: "We're excited to \"help\" your team" becomes "We're excited to \\\"help\\\" your team"
