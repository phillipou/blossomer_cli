You are evaluating content redundancy between sections of a company analysis.

## Description Section
{{ description }}

## Business Insights Section
{% for insight in business_insights %}
- {{ insight }}
{% endfor %}

## Task
Check if the business insights significantly duplicate content from the description.

Calculate word-level overlap and determine if there's excessive duplication.

## Pass Criteria
Jaccard similarity should be < 0.30 (less than 30% overlap).

## Instructions
1. Extract key concepts/words from both sections
2. Calculate overlap percentage
3. Determine if sections provide distinct value

## Response Format
Respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
```json
{
  "pass": true/false,
  "similarity_score": 0.XX,
  "overlap_percentage": XX.X,
  "details": [
    {
      "section": "description_vs_insights",
      "overlap_words": ["word1", "word2"],
      "unique_description": ["unique1", "unique2"],
      "unique_insights": ["unique1", "unique2"],
      "reason": "brief explanation of overlap assessment"
    }
