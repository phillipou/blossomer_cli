You are evaluating content redundancy between sections of a company analysis.

## Description Section
{{ description }}

## Business Insights Section
{% for insight in business_insights %}
- {{ insight }}
{% endfor %}

## Task
Check if the business insights significantly duplicate content from the description.

Calculate word-level overlap and determine if there's excessive duplication.

## Pass Criteria
Jaccard similarity should be < 0.30 (less than 30% overlap).

## Instructions
1. Extract key concepts/words from both sections
2. Calculate overlap percentage
3. Determine if sections provide distinct value

## Response Format
Respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
```json
{
  "check_name": "redundancy",
  "description": "Checks for excessive content duplication between different sections",
  "inputs_evaluated": [
    {"field": "description", "value": {{ description|tojson }}},
    {"field": "business_insights", "value": {{ business_insights|tojson }}}
  ],
  "pass": true/false,
  "rationale": "2-3 sentence explanation of why the check passed or failed, including the overlap percentage and whether the sections provide distinct value or contain excessive duplication."
}
```
