## Evaluation Rules
{% if context_type == "valid" %}
**Valid Context**: Analysis should incorporate relevant details from user context.
The analysis should show clear evidence of using the user-provided information to enhance insights.
{% elif context_type == "noise" %}
**Noise Context**: Analysis should ignore gibberish and focus on core website content.
The analysis should not be influenced by irrelevant or nonsensical context.
{% endif %}

## Pass Criteria

- At least one insight clearly incorporates user-provided information
- The incorporation should be natural and relevant
- User context should enhance rather than distract from the analysis
{% elif context_type == "noise" %}
- Analysis ignores irrelevant context and stays focused on website content
- No signs of confusion or distraction from the noise context
- Insights remain coherent and website-focused
{% endif %}
