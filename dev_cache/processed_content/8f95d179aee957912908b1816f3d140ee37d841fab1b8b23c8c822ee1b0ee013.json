### Spiraling Costs
The Silent Budget Killer
Cloud costs that spiral out of control can turn innovation into a financial nightmare. Without proper governance, spending grows faster than value delivery:
- •Untracked resource provisioning
- •Over-provisioned environments
- •Lack of automated cost optimization
- •Poor visibility into cost drivers
Effective cost management requires real-time monitoring, automated rightsizing, and clear accountability across teams.
