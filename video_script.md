## **Director's Notes**

### **Pacing**
- Speak slightly faster than normal conversation
- Pause for 2-3 seconds when highlighting key insights
- Let progress bars run for visual interest
- Never wait for full generation - cut to results

### **Visual Focus**
- Keep terminal output large and readable
- Highlight specific lines with mouse/cursor
- Use quick cuts between steps to maintain energy
- Show typing in real-time for authenticity

### **Key Emphasis Points**
1. **"$15,000 for this exact analysis"** - Make this personal and specific
2. **"Would you open that email? I would."** - Direct engagement with viewer
3. **"Three minutes. Complete GTM strategy."** - The core value prop
4. **"Try it on your company right now"** - Clear, immediate CTA

### **Backup Lines** (if timing is tight)
- Cut: File structure explanation
- Shorten: Any step-by-step process explanation
- Compress: Montage section to bullet points only

### **Success Metrics**
- Viewer says "I need to try this"
- Technical founders share with their teams  
- Clear understanding of step-by-step intelligence building
- Strong association: Blossomer = GTM expertise
