# Blossomer GTM CLI

This CLI tool is a **prototype of the internal AI workflows used at Blossomer**. We've open-sourced it so you can tweak the prompts and systems to work perfectly for your specific needs. Think of it as a peek behind the curtain of how modern GTM intelligence actually works.

**With Blossomer's CLI, you can generate:**

• **Company Overview**: Automatically analyze any website to extract business model, value propositions, and competitive positioning
• **Target Account Profile**: Generate detailed ICP definitions with firmographic criteria and buying signals  
• **Buyer Persona**: Create comprehensive personas with pain points, goals, and purchase journey mapping
• **Email Campaigns**: Build personalized outreach sequences using our proven "Lego Block" methodology
• **Strategic Plan**: Generate complete execution roadmaps with tool recommendations and success metrics

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- **Firecrawl API key** - Get one at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) for website scraping
- **TensorBlock API key** - Get one at [tensorblock.co](https://tensorblock.co) for AI model access (supports 19+ models including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/blossomer-cli.git
cd blossomer-cli
make install

# Set up your API keys
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-firecrawl-key-here"
export FORGE_API_KEY="your-tensorblock-key-here"

# Generate your first GTM package
blossomer init <your-company-website>
```

## Concepts

### Project Organization
Projects are **named after the domain of the company's website**. When you run `blossomer init stripe.com`, it creates a project folder called `stripe.com` that contains all the generated GTM assets for that company.

```
gtm_projects/
├── stripe.com/          # Project for Stripe
├── shopify.com/         # Project for Shopify  
├── notion.so/           # Project for Notion
└── your-company.com/    # Project for your company
```

This makes it easy to:
- **Work on multiple companies** simultaneously
- **Switch between projects** using `--domain` flags
- **Organize your GTM research** by company
- **Share specific company analyses** as needed

### Project Structure

Generated projects are organized like this:

```
gtm_projects/
├── stripe.com/
│   ├── .metadata.json    # Project metadata
│   ├── overview.json     # Company analysis
│   ├── account.json      # Target account profile
│   ├── persona.json      # Buyer persona
│   ├── email.json        # Email campaigns
│   └── plan.json         # Strategic execution plan
└── acme.com/
    └── ...
```

### The 5-Step GTM Generation Process
1. **Company Overview**: Scrapes and analyzes the website to understand business model and positioning
2. **Target Account Profile**: Defines ideal customer profile with buying signals and firmographic criteria
3. **Buyer Persona**: Creates detailed personas with pain points, goals, and decision-making process
4. **Email Campaigns**: Generates personalized outreach using proven messaging frameworks
5. **Strategic Plan**: Builds complete execution roadmap with tools, metrics, and prioritization

Each step builds on the previous ones, creating a comprehensive GTM package that's immediately actionable.
