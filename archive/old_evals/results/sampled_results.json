Your goal is to fill out a structured discovery template that will help us understand the prospect and identify potential ways to help them scale their go-to-market.\n\n## Analysis Instructions\n\n### QUALITY STANDARDS\n\nBefore finalizing any section, verify:\n\n1. Can each point be traced to source material?\n   - Every claim must have a direct source in the website content\n   - If inferring, mark with [ASSUMPTION] and explain the basis in metadata\n   - Do not make unsupported claims about competitors or market position\n\n2. Are insights actionable and specific?\n   - Each point should lead to a clear discovery question or follow-up\n   - Avoid generic statements that could apply to any company\n   - Include specific examples, metrics, or evidence when available\n\n3. Is the analysis balanced and comprehensive?\n   - Cover both strengths and potential challenges\n   - Address technical, business, and user perspectives\n   - Consider implementation, adoption, and scaling aspects\n\n4. Are gaps and uncertainties clearly marked?\n   - Use [MISSING] for important missing information\n   - Add discovery questions for unclear areas\n   - Don't speculate without marking assumptions\n\n5. Is the language precise and professional?\n   - Use industry-standard terminology\n   - Avoid marketing fluff or hyperbole\n   - Be objective and evidence-based\n\n### ANALYSIS APPROACH\n\n- **Website Content Analysis**: When website content is provided, prioritize specific information over general assumptions\n- **Content Quality**: If website content is insufficient or unclear, mark assumptions clearly with [ASSUMPTION] in metadata\n- Focus on extracting insights that would be valuable for discovery call preparation\n  - What questions would a sales engineer need answered?\n  - What technical challenges might come up?\n  - What integration points need to be explored?\n\n- Identify specific pain points, use cases, and positioning that indicate GTM scaling opportunities\n  - Look for mentions of growth, scale, or expansion\n  - Note any enterprise features or capabilities\n  - Identify potential bottlenecks or friction points\n\n- Look for evidence of customer success, market positioning, and competitive differentiation\n  - Case studies and testimonials\n  - Integration partners and ecosystem\n  - Unique technical approaches or methodologies\n\n- Note gaps where additional discovery questions would be valuable\n  - Technical architecture details\n  - Implementation requirements\n  - Security and compliance needs\n\n- Mark assumptions clearly with \"[ASSUMPTION]\" prefix when inferring from limited data\n  - Base assumptions on industry standards\n  - Explain the reasoning behind each assumption\n  - Consider alternative possibilities\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Your goal is to fill out a structured discovery template that will help us understand the prospect and identify potential ways to help them scale their go-to-market.\n\n## Analysis Instructions\n\n### QUALITY STANDARDS\n\nBefore finalizing any section, verify:\n\n1. Can each point be traced to source material?\n   - Every claim must have a direct source in the website content\n   - If inferring, mark with [ASSUMPTION] and explain the basis in metadata\n   - Do not make unsupported claims about competitors or market position\n\n2. Are insights actionable and specific?\n   - Each point should lead to a clear discovery question or follow-up\n   - Avoid generic statements that could apply to any company\n   - Include specific examples, metrics, or evidence when available\n\n3. Is the analysis balanced and comprehensive?\n   - Cover both strengths and potential challenges\n   - Address technical, business, and user perspectives\n   - Consider implementation, adoption, and scaling aspects\n\n4. Are gaps and uncertainties clearly marked?\n   - Use [MISSING] for important missing information\n   - Add discovery questions for unclear areas\n   - Don't speculate without marking assumptions\n\n5. Is the language precise and professional?\n   - Use industry-standard terminology\n   - Avoid marketing fluff or hyperbole\n   - Be objective and evidence-based\n\n### ANALYSIS APPROACH\n\n- **Website Content Analysis**: When website content is provided, prioritize specific information over general assumptions\n- **Content Quality**: If website content is insufficient or unclear, mark assumptions clearly with [ASSUMPTION] in metadata\n- Focus on extracting insights that would be valuable for discovery call preparation\n  - What questions would a sales engineer need answered?\n  - What technical challenges might come up?\n  - What integration points need to be explored?\n\n- Identify specific pain points, use cases, and positioning that indicate GTM scaling opportunities\n  - Look for mentions of growth, scale, or expansion\n  - Note any enterprise features or capabilities\n  - Identify potential bottlenecks or friction points\n\n- Look for evidence of customer success, market positioning, and competitive differentiation\n  - Case studies and testimonials\n  - Integration partners and ecosystem\n  - Unique technical approaches or methodologies\n\n- Note gaps where additional discovery questions would be valuable\n  - Technical architecture details\n  - Implementation requirements\n  - Security and compliance needs\n\n- Mark assumptions clearly with \"[ASSUMPTION]\" prefix when inferring from limited data\n  - Base assumptions on industry standards\n  - Explain the reasoning behind each assumption\n  - Consider alternative possibilities\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Your goal is to fill out a structured discovery template that will help us understand the prospect and identify potential ways to help them scale their go-to-market.\n\n## Analysis Instructions\n\n### QUALITY STANDARDS\n\nBefore finalizing any section, verify:\n\n1. Can each point be traced to source material?\n   - Every claim must have a direct source in the website content\n   - If inferring, mark with [ASSUMPTION] and explain the basis in metadata\n   - Do not make unsupported claims about competitors or market position\n\n2. Are insights actionable and specific?\n   - Each point should lead to a clear discovery question or follow-up\n   - Avoid generic statements that could apply to any company\n   - Include specific examples, metrics, or evidence when available\n\n3. Is the analysis balanced and comprehensive?\n   - Cover both strengths and potential challenges\n   - Address technical, business, and user perspectives\n   - Consider implementation, adoption, and scaling aspects\n\n4. Are gaps and uncertainties clearly marked?\n   - Use [MISSING] for important missing information\n   - Add discovery questions for unclear areas\n   - Don't speculate without marking assumptions\n\n5. Is the language precise and professional?\n   - Use industry-standard terminology\n   - Avoid marketing fluff or hyperbole\n   - Be objective and evidence-based\n\n### ANALYSIS APPROACH\n\n- **Website Content Analysis**: When website content is provided, prioritize specific information over general assumptions\n- **Content Quality**: If website content is insufficient or unclear, mark assumptions clearly with [ASSUMPTION] in metadata\n- Focus on extracting insights that would be valuable for discovery call preparation\n  - What questions would a sales engineer need answered?\n  - What technical challenges might come up?\n  - What integration points need to be explored?\n\n- Identify specific pain points, use cases, and positioning that indicate GTM scaling opportunities\n  - Look for mentions of growth, scale, or expansion\n  - Note any enterprise features or capabilities\n  - Identify potential bottlenecks or friction points\n\n- Look for evidence of customer success, market positioning, and competitive differentiation\n  - Case studies and testimonials\n  - Integration partners and ecosystem\n  - Unique technical approaches or methodologies\n\n- Note gaps where additional discovery questions would be valuable\n  - Technical architecture details\n  - Implementation requirements\n  - Security and compliance needs\n\n- Mark assumptions clearly with \"[ASSUMPTION]\" prefix when inferring from limited data\n  - Base assumptions on industry standards\n  - Explain the reasoning behind each assumption\n  - Consider alternative possibilities\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON.
